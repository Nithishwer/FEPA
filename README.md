[![Tests](https://github.com/Nithishwer/FEPA/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Nithishwer/FEPA/actions/workflows/test.yml)


**FEPA** (Free Energy Perturbation Analysis) is a Python package for analyzing molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories from FEP simulations, particularly **ABFEs**. FEPA allows you to visualize conformational changes and set up simulations to correct free energy estimates.

This guide covers installation, basic usage, and key workflows.
